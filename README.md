# Programmed-solutions-for-Gyroscope-and-Governor.-
Course project under Dynamics of Machines, formulating calculations on Gyroscope and Governor, through executable computer programs using source codes written in C and C++


A gyroscope is a device used for measuring or maintaining orientation and angular velocity.A
governor, or speed limiter or controller, is a device used to measure and regulate the speed of a
machine, such as an engine.Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a
process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer
programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding,
generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness
and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of
algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in C and C++
programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that
will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem.this project includes
solutions to various problems on Governors and Gyroscopes.
